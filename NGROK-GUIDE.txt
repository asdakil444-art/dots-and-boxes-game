# Making Your Game Public with ngrok

## Quick Start

1. **Download ngrok** (if not already done):
   - Go to: https://ngrok.com/download
   - Download Windows version
   - Extract `ngrok.exe` to this folder

2. **Sign up for free** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
   - Get your authtoken
   - Run: `ngrok authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

3. **Start the public server**:
   - Double-click `start-public-server.bat`
   - Wait for the ngrok URL to appear
   - Share the URL (looks like: https://abc123.ngrok.io)

## Manual Method

If you prefer to run commands manually:

**Step 1:** Start your game server (in one terminal):
```bash
node server.js
```

**Step 2:** In another terminal, run ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

**Step 3:** Look for the "Forwarding" line in ngrok output:
```
Forwarding  https://abc123-def456.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
```

**Step 4:** Share the https:// URL with anyone!

## Tips

- **Free ngrok URLs expire after 2 hours** and change every time you restart
- For a permanent URL, you need a paid ngrok plan
- Anyone with the URL can play your game
- The URL is secure (https) and encrypted

## Troubleshooting

**"ngrok is not recognized"**
- Make sure ngrok.exe is in this folder
- Or add ngrok to your system PATH

**"Failed to complete tunnel connection"**
- Make sure your server is running on port 8080
- Check that start-server.bat is working first

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Free accounts have limits
- Sign up for a free ngrok account to get more bandwidth
